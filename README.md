# FInal-Project-Phys-4200-
Python Notebook with two projects Optimization and Data Analysis

The first project is an Optmization problem. In the problem I tried to minimize the time is takes to travel to an island. 
The second project is data analysis. In the project, I analyze the a ratio of abundance of elements after the major processes of nucleosynthesis like BBN and Stellar nucleosynthesis.
